== Getting Started

DNM - REALLY DNM

You'll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use
https://sigs.k8s.io/kind[KIND] to get a local cluster for testing, or run
against a remote cluster.  *Note:* Your controller will automatically use the
current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl
cluster-info` shows).

=== Running on the cluster

. Install Instances of Custom Resources:
+
[,sh]
----
 kubectl apply -f config/samples/
----

. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
+
[,sh]
----
 make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/dataplane-operator:tag
----

. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:
+
[,sh]
----
 make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/dataplane-operator:tag
----

=== Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

[,sh]
----
make uninstall
----

=== Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

[,sh]
----
make undeploy
----

=== How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/[Operator pattern]

It uses https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/[Controllers]
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources
until the desired state is reached on the cluster

=== Test It Out

. Install the CRDs into the cluster:
+
[,sh]
----
 make install
----

. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):
+
[,sh]
----
 make run
----

*NOTE:* You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

=== Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

[,sh]
----
make manifests
----

*NOTE:* Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
